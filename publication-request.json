This domain involves care for patients with an incurable illness or condition from which they are expected to die. Developed by the Netherlands Comprehensive Cancer Organisation (Dutch: Integraal kankercentrum Nederland (IKNL)), this guide provides technical direction for using FHIR to exchange ACP data. It is based on HL7 FHIR STU3 and builds on top of the Dutch Core STU3 profiles."
