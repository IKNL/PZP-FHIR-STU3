#### 1.0.0-rc1

| Issue | Short Description |
|-------|-------------------|
| [#44](https://github.com/IKNL/PZP-FHIR-R4/issues/44) | Updated the Goal search query to directly use SNOMED codes instead of referencing the `ACP-MedicalPolicyGoal` value set, following HL7 validation feedback. |

| [#22](https://github.com/IKNL/PZP-FHIR-R4/issues/22) | Included links to the GitHub repository and issue tracker in both the STU3 and R4 Implementation Guides. |
